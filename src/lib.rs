///
/// # Why both halves are signed
///
/// FFmpeg's rational is signed — `AVRational { int num; int den; }` — and it is
/// the type this crate exists to interoperate with: `av_rescale_q` takes two of
/// them, `AVFrame::time_base` is one, and `AVFrame::pts` is an `int64_t` whose
/// `AV_NOPTS_VALUE` sentinel is `i64::MIN`, so signedness is load-bearing
/// throughout that API. An unsigned numerator or denominator above `i32::MAX`
/// is representable but **cannot round-trip into an `AVRational`** — usable in
/// Rust, unusable at the boundary. Matching the width and the sign removes that
/// failure mode by construction.
///
/// Storage points the same way: `sqlx` has no `Type<Postgres>`/`Encode<Postgres>`
/// for `u32`, whereas `i32` is a native `INTEGER` on PostgreSQL, MySQL and
/// SQLite alike, so a storage face reads these fields directly instead of
/// widening to `i64` and narrowing back through an error path.
///
/// Two other decoder SDKs were surveyed and impose no counter-pressure:
/// Blackmagic RAW (`GetFrameRate(float*)`) and RED R3D
/// (`float VideoAudioFramerate()`) are frame-indexed with a floating-point
/// rate and never hand out a rational at all.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// `num >= 0` and `den > 0`. `NonZeroI32` carries only the non-zero half, so
/// the rest is enforced by [`Timebase::new`] (and by every setter, which routes
/// through it). A **zero numerator stays legal**: it is a degenerate timebase,
/// valid to construct and to compare, but not a valid rescale target — see
/// [`Timebase::checked_rescale`].
///
/// `AVRational` itself permits a negative denominator and normalizes the sign
/// into the numerator via `av_reduce`; that is a convention rather than a type
/// guarantee, and `AVRational` is laxer than this crate needs because it also
/// serves aspect ratios. Here it is a type-level guarantee instead.
///
/// # Equality and ordering
///
/// Comparison is **value-based**: `1/2` equals `2/4`, and `1/3 < 2/3 < 1/1`.
/// [`Hash`] hashes the reduced (lowest-terms) form, so equal rationals hash
/// the same. Cross-multiplication uses `i64` intermediates — exact for any
/// `i32` numerator / denominator.
///
/// # The well-known roster
///
/// The constants on this type are the timebases containers and codecs
/// actually declare, each with a name [`Self::from_name`] reads and
/// [`Self::well_known_name`] writes back. They come in three families:
///
/// - **Clock subdivisions** — [`SECONDS`](Self::SECONDS),
///   [`MILLIS`](Self::MILLIS), [`MICROS`](Self::MICROS) and
///   [`NANOS`](Self::NANOS), plus [`MPEG_90K`](Self::MPEG_90K), the fixed
///   clock MPEG counts PTS in.
/// - **Audio sample intervals** — fourteen, [`HZ_8K`](Self::HZ_8K) up to
///   [`HZ_192K`](Self::HZ_192K): one tick per sample at each rate the audio
///   codecs declare.
/// - **Frame intervals** — eight, the reciprocals of [`Rate`]'s eight frame
///   rates entry for entry. An `NTSC_` prefix marks the three carrying NTSC's
///   1001 pulldown ([`NTSC_FILM`](Self::NTSC_FILM),
///   [`NTSC_VIDEO`](Self::NTSC_VIDEO), [`NTSC_60`](Self::NTSC_60)); the other
///   five are exact, and are named for the convention that declares them
///   ([`FILM_24`](Self::FILM_24), [`PAL_25`](Self::PAL_25),
///   [`VIDEO_30`](Self::VIDEO_30) and so on).
///
/// Every one of them is a **timebase**: seconds per tick. The frame-rate
/// entries are therefore the *reciprocals* of the rate they are named for —
/// [`FILM_24`](Self::FILM_24) is `1/24`, not `24/1` — because a PTS timebase
/// and a frame rate are reciprocal readings of one rational. [`Rate`] is the
/// other reading, with its own roster over the reciprocal values, and
/// [`Self::checked_recip`] is the conversion under both of them.
///
/// ## What earns a name
///
/// A name is worth carrying where every file that declares the value means
/// the same thing by it, so the roster holds the values a *convention* travels
/// with: a codec's sample rate, a region's frame rate, a container's fixed
/// clock. Matroska's default `TimecodeScale` and FLV's timestamps are both
/// millisecond counts, so both read as [`MILLIS`](Self::MILLIS) — one value,
/// one name, and no container-specific alias standing beside it. An MP4/MOV
/// timescale is chosen per file by the muxer, so it carries no convention to
/// name and this type carries it as the rational it is.

///
/// The half-openness shows through in three places, all deliberate. An

/// belongs to exactly one of two abutting ranges. `overlaps` is strict at
/// both ends, so `[0, 10)` and `[10, 20)` abut without overlapping. `contains`
/// and `within` admit coinciding ends, so a range contains itself.
///
/// A **zero-length range** `[a, a)` follows from the same formulas rather
/// than from a rule of its own:
///
/// - it contains no instant, not even `a`;
/// - it overlaps a range `[x, y)` only when `x < a < y` — never at either end
///   of it, and never another zero-length range;
/// - `[x, y)` contains it whenever `x <= a <= y`, its own end included, and
///   it is then `within` `[x, y)`.
///
/// The predicates read the instants the endpoints name, not the counts:
/// under a degenerate `0/den` timebase both endpoints name instant zero, so
/// such a range is the zero-length range at zero whatever its counts.
///
/// Two readings a caller may want are **not** this type's to decide: an
/// open-ended range (one with no end yet) is not representable here, and
/// whether a window of no length "sits at" an instant it touches is a
/// product rule. Both belong to the caller, on top of these predicates.
///
/// # Equality and ordering
///
/// Equality is derived, and so **structural**: both counts are compared as
/// written, and only the timebase is compared by value. `[1500, 3250) @ 1/1000`
/// therefore equals the same pair over `2/2000` but not `[135_000, 292_500)`
/// over `1/90000`, though they cover the same stretch of time. [`Hash`] agrees
/// with that equality.
///
/// There is **no [`Ord`]**, the posture [`SignedDuration`] takes as well.
/// Ranges have no single order to derive: by start, by end and by length are
/// three different answers, and overlapping ranges are not ordered at all.
/// Compare the part you mean — [`Self::start`] and [`Self::end`] hand back
/// [`Timestamp`]s, which *are* ordered, and by the instant rather than by the
